<size=90%>The game <b>First Principles</b> takes its name from public remarks by <b>Elon Musk</b> on a <b>first-principles approach</b> to <b>business</b> and to <b>solving problems in life and work</b>—then teaches <b>calculus-first</b> ideas on the graph as a matching metaphor.</size>
<size=90%>Use <b>Math concepts</b> while playing, or <b>Math tips & snippets</b> on Level select — same scrollable notes. Tap the dark backdrop or <b>Close</b> to dismiss.</size>

<b><size=115%>How this game teaches calculus (read the graph while you play)</size></b>
<size=92%>
• <b>Main curve</b> — the thick path on the Cartesian grid is \(y = f(x)\) for this stage. Your character tries to stand on platforms that follow that shape. The <b>Equation</b> label (when visible) names the rule being plotted.

• <b>Derivative curve \(f'(x)\)</b> — drawn as a second graph; values come from a <i>numerical</i> derivative (sampled slopes). On many levels, <b>where \(f'\) is large enough you get solid ground</b>; where it falls short you can fall through — the platformer is tied to slope logic.

• <b>Stages & “pops”</b> — the <b>Stage</b> HUD counts story beats. As you move right, the derivative visualization can <i>pop</i> or recolor at set \(x\)-values (like curtain lifts between ideas in a lesson).

• <b>Riemann sums / area</b> — some levels shade rectangles or build <i>stair</i> platforms from left-, right-, or midpoint-rule samples. That pictures \(\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx\) as the limit of \(\sum f(x^\ast)\,\Delta x\).

• <b>Story text</b> — the banner at the top ties each level to the math (series, polar, physics metaphors, etc.). Pause and read; it fades so the run stays readable. The <b>First Principles Primer</b> also nudges <b>first-principles business</b> thinking (reason from fundamentals vs analogy).

Everything below is a <b>topic glossary</b> you can skim between deaths or after finishing a graph — plus a <b>First principles thinking (business)</b> section before exam prep.
</size>

<b><size=110%>1. Derivatives = slope & rate</size></b>
The derivative \(f'(x)\) measures how steeply \(f(x)\) rises or falls. In physics it is often a <i>rate</i>: how fast position changes (velocity), how fast temperature changes along a bar, etc. In this game, the derivative helps decide where the ground exists.

<b><size=120%>──────── Differentiation rules — your skill tree ────────</size></b>
<size=92%>These are the <b>combo moves</b> for turning \(f(x)\) into \(f'(x)\) without rebuilding from the limit every time. Read them like <b>perks</b> that change how your <b>main curve</b> and <b>derivative HUD</b> stay in sync.</size>

<b><size=110%>Power rule — “exponent is the multiplier”</size></b>
If \(y = x^n\) (on domains where it’s defined), \(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}x^n = n x^{\,n-1}\). <i>Game feel:</i> your <b>stage power</b> isn’t just decoration — it says how fast tilt <b>ramps</b> as you leave the origin; the derivative plot drops the exponent by one like a <b>nerf patch</b> that still keeps the same story arc.

<b><size=110%>Constant multiple — “global buff”</size></b>
\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[k\,f(x)] = k\,f'(x)\). Stretch the graph vertically and <b>every slope</b> scales the same — like one upgrade tile that multiplies jump <i>and</i> hazard steepness together.

<b><size=110%>Sum / difference — “stacked modifiers”</size></b>
\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \pm g(x)] = f'(x) \pm g'(x)\). Two effects glued into one run: read each piece’s slope, then <b>add or subtract</b> — same vibe as summing two platform scripts in a mash-up stage.

<b><size=110%>Product rule — “dual meters both matter”</size></b>
\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[u(x)\,v(x)] = u'(x)\,v(x) + u(x)\,v'(x)\). Neither factor can “AFK”: when one is flat the other still carries signal. Think <b>two HUD bars</b> cross-charging — you get \(\,u'v\,\) <i>plus</i> \(\,uv'\,\).

<b><size=110%>Quotient rule — “top lane vs bottom lane”</size></b>
\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\frac{u(x)}{v(x)} = \frac{u'(x)\,v(x) - u(x)\,v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2}\) (where \(v(x)\neq 0\)). Numerator is a <b>race tape</b>: leading push \(u'v\) minus catch-up \(uv'\); denominator \(v^2\) is the <b>shield</b> squaring the bottom track. Zeros or blows in \(v\) = <b>boss phase change</b> — rule off, asymptotes/poles ahead.

<b><size=110%>Chain rule — “nested stages”</size></b>
If \(y = f(g(x))\), then \(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)\). <i>Outer sensitivity × inner sensitivity.</i> Same energy as \(u = k(x-D)\): nudge \(x\), the <b>inner</b> \(u\) wiggles, then the <b>outer</b> \(f\) reacts. If the inner slope is tiny, the whole combo “fizzles” — that missing factor is why chain-rule mistakes feel like <b>input lag</b>.

<size=92%>The game still draws \(f'\) with a <b>numeric sampler</b> on wild stages, but these identities explain <i>why</i> textbook curves snap into clean forms — and what AP / TMUA expects you to simplify before you sketch. Longer write-up: <b>docs/derivative-rules.md</b>.</size>

<b><size=120%>──────── Integrals: definite vs indefinite — score vs loadout ────────</size></b>
<size=92%><b>Indefinite</b> \(\displaystyle \int f(x)\,dx\) asks for an <b>antiderivative</b> — a whole <i>family</i> \(F(x)+C\) whose derivative is \(f\). Think <b>loadout class</b>: many valid builds differ by +\(C\) (same gameplay up to vertical shift in \(F\)). <b>Definite</b> \(\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx\) is a single <b>number</b> (signed area from \(a\) to \(b\)) — like a <b>run score</b> for one fixed segment. No “+\(C\)” in the answer: endpoints pin it down.</size>

<b><size=110%>FTC bridge — “endgame check”</size></b>
If \(F' = f\), then \(\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b)-F(a)\) (usual hypotheses). You grind the <b>indefinite recipe</b> once, then subtract boundary values — boss HP bars at \(x=b\) minus \(x=a\).

<b><size=110%>Riemann stages — “pixel buckets”</size></b>
Rectangles (left / right / midpoint) estimate the <b>definite</b> score before you take \(\Delta x \to 0\). Wider columns = chunky pixels; refine = smoother total — same loop as §8 below.

<size=92%>More detail: <b>docs/definite-indefinite-integrals.md</b>. (Graphing calculator / FTC proofs — see course notes; this is the game glossary.)</size>

<b><size=110%>2. Parabola (power / quadratic)</size></b>
A quadratic \(y = a(x-h)^2+k\) is the shape of projectile motion in ideal textbook setups and many optimization problems (min/max). One smooth hump; the slope switches sign at the vertex.

<b><size=110%>3. Sine & cosine = waves & rotation</size></b>
Sines and cosines describe vibrations, AC signals, sound, and anything that repeats. Cosine is sine shifted: same wave, different starting phase. Complex numbers (below) make these waves easier to solve in circuits and vibrations.

<b><size=110%>4. Absolute value & kinks</size></b>
\(|x|\) bends the graph so there is a corner on the axis. The derivative jumps there in ideal math — in real programs we plot smooth samples, but the idea matters: nonsmooth points need special care in analysis and simulation.

<b><size=110%>5. Taylor & Maclaurin series</size></b>
Smooth functions can be approximated near a point by polynomials with matching derivatives. Maclaurin means “expand around \(0\).” More terms usually improve the fit nearby; the full infinite sum is the series (where it converges).

<b><size=110%>6. Geometric series</size></b>
Sums \(u^0+u^1+u^2+\cdots\) appear in probability, signal processing, and digital math. When \(|u|<1\) the tail shrinks and the infinite sum has a clean closed form; that is the same mood as stability and “things settle.”

<b><size=110%>7. Multivariable slices</size></b>
Surfaces \(z = f(x,y)\) can be cut by fixing \(y=y_0\) — you get a 1D curve in \(x\). That is how higher-dimensional calculus is often reasoned about in engineering: fix all but one variable, take partial derivatives, gradients, directional slopes.

<b><size=110%>8. Integrals & area (Riemann sums)</size></b>
The definite integral \(\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx\) is the signed area under the curve. Riemann sums chop \([a,b]\) into thin rectangles: pick sample heights (left, right, midpoint), add \(f(x^\ast)\,\Delta x\). More rectangles → closer to the true integral.

<b><size=110%>9. Engineering math — modeling mindset</size></b>
Engineering math picks tools that match the world: linear algebra for structures and networks, complex numbers / phasors for steady AC, differential equations for motion and heat, transforms (Laplace/Fourier) for signals and control. The goal is a <i>usable model</i>, then check it against reality.

<b><size=110%>10. Damped oscillation</size></b>
Many systems lose energy while oscillating: \(e^{-\alpha t}\sin(\omega t)\) style decay is the cartoon of that idea — envelope shrinks, oscillation persists briefly. Mechanical damping, resistor–capacitor–inductor circuits, and control systems all share this language.

<b><size=110%>11. Catenary & cosh</size></b>
A hanging cable under its own weight forms a catenary; \(\cosh\) is the hyperbolic cosine that models that ideal shape (and shows up in hyperbolic PDEs and relativity too). Different from a parabola even if both look “like arches.”

<b><size=110%>12. Rectified sine \(|\sin|\)</size></b>
Full-wave rectification flips negative lobes upward — a first step in turning AC into something closer to DC for power supplies. Corners at zeros mean derivatives jump — a reminder that idealized circuits still start from calculus intuitions.

<b><size=110%>13. Circle \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = R^2\)</size></b>
A circle is usually written implicitly. Solving for \(y\) gives two branches (\(\pm\sqrt{\cdot}\)). The game’s circle stage uses the <i>upper</i> semicircle so the path stays a function \(y(x)\) over one sweep. Implicit differentiation yields \(\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x-h}{y-k}\); at the ends of the diameter the tangent is vertical (slope blows up).

<b><size=120%>──────── Aerospace engineering & aerodynamics ────────</size></b>
<size=92%>Levels prefixed <b>Aerospace:</b> turn textbook flight‑vehicle math into paths you run. They are <i>toy models</i> for pedagogy — not CFD, flight test, or ITAR‑grade simulations.</size>

<b><size=118%>Lift, drag, atmosphere</size></b>
\(C_L(\alpha)\) grows ~linearly before <b>stall</b> (flow separation), then drops — slopes & breakpoints drive your platforms. Drag polar \(C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2\) is a parabola in \(C_L\): min‑drag sweet spots matter for glide & endurance. Isothermal atmosphere uses \(\rho(h) \propto e^{-h/H}\) (scale height \(H\)): density drives \(q = \tfrac{1}{2}\rho V^2\), Reynolds, thrust lapse.

<b><size=118%>Stability, unsteady aero, entry</size></b>
<b>Phugoid / short‑period</b> moods use damped sinusoids from linearized dynamics (eigenvalues in state space). <b>Strouhal</b> shedding ties frequency to \(U/D\) with sine‑like traces. <b>Newtonian \(\sin^2\alpha\)</b> sketches hypersonic windward pressure teaching curves. <b>Re‑entry decay</b> uses an exponential envelope mood for “how fast heating threat relaxes” in simplified stories.

<b><size=90%>See docs/engineering-math.md § Aerospace for a longer map.</size></b>

<b><size=120%>──────── First principles thinking (business) ────────</size></b>
<size=92%>Startup culture often cites <b>Elon Musk</b> for reviving <b>first principles</b> at places like <b>Tesla / SpaceX</b>: stop trusting “the market always prices it this way,” and instead <b>unpack assumptions</b> until you hit bedrock facts (materials, energy, physics, true unit costs), then <b>reason upward</b> into a new design. The idea is older than any one founder — but the <i>habit</i> matches this game’s visuals.</size>

<b><size=118%>Map the metaphor</size></b>
• <b>Your mental “business curve”</b> is like <b>f(x)</b> — the story you tell about how output moves with a lever (price, latency, quality, throughput).
• <b>Where it breaks or soars</b> is like <b>f'(x)</b> — <i>sensitivity</i>. Same as here: derivative magnitude decides whether the “floor” (your plan) actually holds.
• <b>Stages & pops</b> — slice the bet into acts; each reveal is a new hypothesis. <b>Riemann / area levels</b> — many small choices sum; refine the grid before you scale spend.
• <b>Multivariable slices</b> — fix hidden variables on purpose; one clear 1D walk beats a fuzzy 4D slide deck.

<b><size=92%>This is <i>not</i> legal, tax, or investing advice — a thinking drill you can pair with real advisors and data. Full write-up:</size></b> <b>docs/first-principles-business.md</b> on GitHub Pages.

<b><size=120%>──────── Exam prep (separate tracks) ────────</size></b>

<b><size=118%>Competition mathematics (contest lens)</size></b>
Problems from contests like <b>AMC / AIME</b> often reward <b>bounding</b>, <b>symmetry</b>, and knowing when a function is <b>concave or convex</b>. Natural log is a classic hub: \(\ln\) is <i>concave</i> on its domain — tangents/secants give linear estimates used in inequalities. In-game stage: <b>Competition math: ln, concavity & bound tricks</b> (before the Mandelbrot boss). <size=90%>Not affiliated with MAA or any contest body.</size> → <b>docs/competition-math.md</b>

<b><size=118%>AMC 10 &amp; AMC 12 (MAA, US)</size></b>
Both are middle/early high-school <b>multiple-choice</b> sprints; <b>calculus is not required</b>. Load-bearing ideas: smart algebra, functions (including logs), coordinate geometry, counting &amp; probability, modular arithmetic. Graph fluency from this game helps with <b>shape intuition</b>, <b>domains</b> (e.g. \(\ln\), \(\sqrt{\cdot}\)), and reading options even when you solve by algebra. <size=90%>Not affiliated with MAA — use official AMC materials for real problems.</size> → <b>docs/amc-10-12.md</b>

<b><size=118%>TMUA — Test of Mathematics for University Admission (UK)</size></b>
Two-paper <b>multiple choice</b>. Calculus shows up as fast <b>chain/product/quotient</b> fluency, sketch reasoning from \(f'\) and \(f''\), \(\int\) as signed area / FTC mood, <b>domains</b> of \(\ln\) & \(\sqrt{\cdot}\), exp/log inequalities, limits & asymptotes. Typical traps: \(|x|\) kinks, endpoint maxima, “exactly one option is true” elimination. <size=90%>No reproduced questions—use official TMUA materials.</size> → <b>docs/tmua-calculus.md</b>

<b><size=118%>MAT — Mathematics Admissions Test (Oxford / UK)</size></b>
Emphasis on <b>multi-step reasoning</b> and exact algebra—not the same pacing as TMUA. Calculus supports <b>graph sense</b>, implicit curves, inequalities, and “how many solutions?” via monotonicity. Format evolves; check Oxford’s official MAT page. <size=90%>No reproduced questions—use official MAT papers.</size> → <b>docs/mat-calculus.md</b>

<b><size=118%>AP Calculus BC (College Board, US)</size></b>
BC stacks <b>series & Taylor</b>, <b>parametric / polar / vector-valued</b> motion, <b>DEs</b> (logistic, separable), and richer integration (incl. improper) beside AB. Polar recap: \(\displaystyle A = \tfrac{1}{2}\int r^2\,d\theta\); arc length \(\displaystyle \int \sqrt{r^2+(dr/d\theta)^2}\,d\theta\). In-game: stages <b>BC:</b>, <b>Polar:</b>, <b>Circle</b>, plus Maclaurin & Riemann levels. <size=90%>Pair with CB Course Description & FRQs.</size> → <b>docs/ap-calculus-bc.md</b>

<b><size=118%>AP Physics C (College Board, US)</size></b>
<b>Calculus-first</b> mechanics & E&amp;M: \(v = dr/dt\), \(a = dv/dt\), work integrals, \(\tau = dL/dt\), \(L = I\omega\) on a fixed axis, angular momentum conservation when \(\tau_{\mathrm{ext}} = 0\); E&amp;M uses flux / line-integral setups.
