# Setup

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|--------|
| **Unity Editor** | **6000.4.0f1** (Unity 6) — see `First Principles/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` |
| **Disk** | Large `Library/` folder; safe to delete and regenerate |
| **OS** | Windows / macOS / Linux (editor-supported) |

Optional: **Git LFS** if you add large assets later (not required for the scripts-focused workflow).

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GameGenesis/First-Principles.git
cd First-Principles
```

If you fork the repo, use your fork URL instead.

## Open the correct Unity project

The Unity project lives in a subfolder **with a space** in the name:

```
First-Principles/First Principles/
```

In **Unity Hub** → **Add** → choose:

`.../First-Principles/First Principles`

You should see `Assets`, `Packages`, and `ProjectSettings` at the root of the added project.

**Common mistake:** adding only `First-Principles` (parent) will not load the Unity project correctly.

## First open / packages

1. Open the project in Unity and wait for **import** and **package restore**.
2. If you use **TextMesh Pro** for the first time, import **TMP Essentials** when prompted (*GameObject → UI → Text - TextMeshPro* often triggers the importer).

## Clean restore (corrupted Library / packages)

If you see compile errors about immutable packages, missing UGUI types, or broken test framework assemblies:

1. Quit Unity.
2. From the repo root run:

   ```bash
   ./clean-unity-library.sh
   ```

3. Reopen the project.

See [Troubleshooting]({% link troubleshooting.md %}) for details.

## Run the game

1. Open scene **`Assets/Scenes/Menu.unity`** (or build settings entry scene).
2. **Play** from the Editor.

Flow: **Menu** → **Level select** → **Game** (chosen level index is passed via `LevelSelection`).

## Optional: local documentation site

From the `docs/` folder (Ruby + Bundler required):

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Browse to `http://localhost:4000/First-Principles/` (include `baseurl` path if configured).
